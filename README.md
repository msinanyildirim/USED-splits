# USED splits
These tsv files contain the information of the splits used in the USED paper. Each tsv file consists of 5 fields in the following order: mixture id, mixture path, extraction output path, reference speech path, speaker id. 

The paths are relative paths. The reference speech files are chosen randomly from the LibriSpeech samples of the same speaker. This randomness can change the performance. Hence, we provide these tsv files to ensure that future experiments can conduct a fair comparison.
